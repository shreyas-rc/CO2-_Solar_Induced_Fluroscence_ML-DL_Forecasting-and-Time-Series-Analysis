Jupyter Notebook Codes on Carbon dioxide modelling and data analysis.
The data associcated, with the code is available in this GIT Repo, please explore and feel free to use and manipulate the code based on your needs. 
There are different codes for each task, for example, one Notebook each in time series forecasting for FbProhet model, one for ARIMA mode and one for
RNN - LSTM. 

I've developed codes for filling Gaps in satellite images using Deep Learning as well.
